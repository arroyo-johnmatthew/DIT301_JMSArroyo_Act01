What challenges did you face installing Android Studio?
  -In my experience, there weren't any struggles or problems I encountered during the installation of Android Studio.
   I just noticed that the installation time was very slow and from time to time, my system experienced a lag spike.

What did you learn about Android app structure
  -I learned that the structure is very complex like the Kernel, which is the one who directly interacts with the hardware.
   I also learned that an Android app structure uses libraries and other languages like Java and xml (which is similar to HTML).
